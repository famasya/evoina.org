Since the early development of evolutionary studies, the Indonesian archipelago (then partially part of the Netherlands East Indies) has served as a source of inspiration and curiosity for foreign naturalists. One of the most notable figures is Alfred Russel Wallace, best known as the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. It was during his time in Ternate around 1858 that he experienced a moment of profound insight, which he later articulated in his famous "Letter from Ternate."

From that letter to today, the idea of natural selection remains one of the most powerful forces that govern the patterns of biodiversity we observe today. However, despite Wallace's legacy and Indonesia's extraordinary biodiversity, the advancement of evolutionary studies in the country has fallen behind. Indonesia, a nation rich in both biological and cultural diversity, is no longer at the forefront of evolutionary research. This untapped potential is particularly concerning at a time when biodiversity faces unprecedented threats. Signatures of evolutionary history, formed over hundreds of millions of years, are at risk of disappearing before they can even be studied or understood.

Alongside the fading public memory of Wallace's legacy in Indonesia, understanding of evolution among the general public is hampered by misinformation and distorted representations of basic evolutionary principles. This creates a dual challenge:

1. Policy-making becomes less informed in the absence of a strong evolutionary foundation, undermining efforts to manage and conserve biodiversity effectively,
2. Education and outreach struggle, making it difficult to cultivate a new generation of Indonesian scientists who can appreciate and protect biodiversity through an evolutionary lens.

Even among professionals/students dedicated to evolutionary-related fields (such as systematics, ecology, evolutionary biology, genomics, and anthropology, etc) many are scattered across the globe with limited opportunities to connect or collaborate. Building a strong community starts with knowing each other. Connection is the first step toward advancing the field and fostering collaborative efforts to change the situation.

Indonesian Society for Evolutionary Studies (ISES) is an effort that we are hoping could contribute in helping to tackle the challenges and shape the future progress of the field in Indonesia. We aim to provide a forum for researchers and students interested in advancing our understanding of the origin, evolution, and maintenance of biodiversity in Indonesia, in hope that it could support collaborative research, promote dialogue across evolutionary-related disciplines, and enhance public understanding of our field. This organisation was initiated on 23 May 2024 through an online meeting with XX global participants invited to discuss the above-mentioned issues. The founding participants are:
